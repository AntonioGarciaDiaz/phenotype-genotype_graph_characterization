# phenotype-genotype_graph_characterization

The goal of this project is to analyze the patterns of phenotype-gene-genotype triplets, to see if they can be characterized to identify new pairs of phenotye-genotype pairs.

Basically, for every phenotype-genotype pair, compute the type and number of paths to go from one to the other. When there is a gene conecting both, eliminate the edge to simulate the scenario where the link is unknown.
